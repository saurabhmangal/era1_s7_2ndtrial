```python
For each layer I have done bias as True to increase the accuracy

Target:
    1. To increase the accuracy of test data set
    2. TO get the consistent accuracy. 
    
Resut:
    Train Accuracy: 98.83
    Test Accuracy: 99.3
        
Analysis:
    Total number of parameters: 8,108
    The accuracy is increased to 99.3 and it is consistent
